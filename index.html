    <h1>Yuzhe Lim: Background and Ambitions</h1>

      I had many ambitions as a child, ranging from being a doctor to a policeman, but
      all my ambitions shared a common goal, which was to build a better, safer, and
      more efficient world. I tried many different things and revised my ambitions as
      I grew up. By God’s grace, I am fortunate to have been given a chance to
      participate in professional work and research experiences in the field of
      computer sciences, where I discovered the many things that computer science can
      achieve. It was then when I realized my true calling - to change the world for
      the better, to create an efficient and safe environment for everyone with the
      help of computer science. I aspire to relieve humans from hazardous jobs and
      make everyone’s life more enjoyable and efficient with artificial intelligence
      and robotics application.

      As I believe that learning is an active process and should not be restricted to
      just the classroom, I eagerly signed up for an undergraduate research under the
      Computer Science Department whereby I examined the different ways of
      incorporating machine learning methodologies into the nonintrusive load
      monitoring (NILM) process for energy disaggregation. My main contribution to
      this project was the development of two data pre-processing tools which reduced
      the time and memory consumption. As I continued to develop the
      project, I successfully delivered a high accuracy ResNet (Residual Networks)
      based semi-supervised learning model after experimenting with other neural
      network architectures such as LSTM (Long short-term memory) and DAE (Denoising
      Autoencoder).

      Aside from my experiences in research, I had an exciting internship working as a
      big data engineering intern at Keysight Technologies during the summer of 2019.
      My first task was to build a big data analytics system to centralize data coming
      from multiple applications. I was also given more opportunities to work on
      several other projects that eventually helped to streamline sophisticated work
      processes and improved work efficiency for the department. For instance, I built
      and trained two artificial neural network models (Autoencoder and XGBOD) for
      data pattern recognition and anomaly detection with 97% accuracy, which
      ultimately replaced the time taxing manual testing performed by the engineers.
      The following semester, I spent my time doing a co-operative education with
      Intel as an IoT software engineering intern. My responsibility focused on two
      parallel projects where the first one was to develop a contextual AI chatbot.
      The most exciting yet challenging part is the chatbot conversation flow design
      with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, which upgraded the scripted
      chatbot to an artificially intelligent chatbot. Upon the successful completion
      of my first chatbot, I was then tasked to automated two legacy debugging tools
      and develop multiple APIs for two other chatbot models.

      I have always believed in a saying which goes by “Logic will get you from A to
      B, but imagination will take you everywhere”, which is what I am hoping to get
      out of this class. I have taken a lot of STEM-related classes which only provide
      me with technical knowledge but not the artistic part. I hope by the end of this
      class, I will be a better version of me in term of web development and
      designing. In general, I aspire to create efficient self-learning robots that
      could help to relieve humans from hazardous jobs, and knowledge in advanced
      artificial intelligence and robotics is essential. Thomas Edison revolutionized
      the world with the invention of the lightbulb, something once thought
      impossible. It is possible to have another major technological revolution to
      change how the world looks at robotics in healthcare. My decision to join the
      artificial intelligence industry boils down to my passion in the field as I am
      fascinated with its application in robotics and how I can make further
      enhancements. It is my strong desire to bring a change in optimizing the usage
      of artificial intelligence in most robotics applications.
