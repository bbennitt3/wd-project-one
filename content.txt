I had many ambitions as a child, ranging from being a doctor to a policeman, but
all my ambitions shared a common goal, which was to build a better, safer, and
more efficient world. I tried many different things and revised my ambitions as
I grew up. By God’s grace, I am fortunate to have been given a chance to
participate in professional work and research experiences in the field of
computer sciences, where I discovered the many things that computer science can
achieve. It was then when I realized my true calling - to change the world for
the better, to create an efficient and safe environment for everyone with the
help of computer science. I aspire to relieve humans from hazardous jobs and
make everyone’s life more enjoyable and efficient with artificial intelligence
and robotics application.
