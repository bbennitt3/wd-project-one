I had many ambitions as a child, ranging from being a doctor to a policeman, but
all my ambitions shared a common goal, which was to build a better, safer, and
more efficient world. I tried many different things and revised my ambitions as
I grew up. By God’s grace, I am fortunate to have been given a chance to
participate in professional work and research experiences in the field of
computer sciences, where I discovered the many things that computer science can
achieve. It was then when I realized my true calling - to change the world for
the better, to create an efficient and safe environment for everyone with the
help of computer science. I aspire to relieve humans from hazardous jobs and
make everyone’s life more enjoyable and efficient with artificial intelligence
and robotics application.

As I believe that learning is an active process and should not be restricted to
just the classroom, I eagerly signed up for an undergraduate research under the
Computer Science Department whereby I examined the different ways of
incorporating machine learning methodologies into the nonintrusive load
monitoring (NILM) process for energy disaggregation. My main contribution to
this project was the development of two data pre-processing tools which reduced
the time and memory consumption. As I continued to develop the
project, I successfully delivered a high accuracy ResNet (Residual Networks)
based semi-supervised learning model after experimenting with other neural
network architectures such as LSTM (Long short-term memory) and DAE (Denoising
Autoencoder).
